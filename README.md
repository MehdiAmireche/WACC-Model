# Weighted Average Cost of Capital Model
This project develops a comprehensive cost of capital framework for Walmart, integrating CAPM-based equity valuation, bond pricing, and Monte Carlo simulation to capture financial uncertainty. Using real market and financial statement data, the model computes Walmart’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) by combining the cost of equity derived from regression-estimated beta and market returns with the cost of debt obtained through yield-to-maturity analysis on Walmart’s bond portfolio. It further incorporates tax effects and capital structure weights to estimate a base WACC of approximately 5%, then simulates 10,000 randomized scenarios to derive a full probability distribution of potential outcomes. A sensitivity regression quantifies each input’s impact—revealing market returns and beta as dominant WACC drivers. This project demonstrates expertise in corporate finance modeling, risk analysis, and data-driven valuation automation using Python.
